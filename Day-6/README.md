# ðŸ’³ C# Payment System using Abstract Classes

This is a C# console application that demonstrates **abstraction** and **polymorphism** using an abstract `Payment` class. The program allows users to choose a payment method (Credit Card, JazzCash, EasyPaisa), enter their details, and process a payment.
